        <p>Hello darkness, my old friend,
          I've come to talk with you again,
          Because a vision softly creeping,
          Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
          And the vision that was planted in my brain
          Still remains
          Within the sound of silence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second-verse">
        <p>In restless dreams I walked alone 
           Narrow streets of cobblestone,
           'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
           I turned my collar to the cold and damp
           When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
           That split the night
           And touched the sound of silence.</p>
