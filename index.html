          <p>Hello darkness, my old friend,
            I've come to talk with you again,
            Because a vision softly creeping,
            Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
            And the vision that was planted in my brain
            Still remains
            Within the sound of silence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second-verse">
          <p>In restless dreams I walked alone 
             Narrow streets of cobblestone,
             'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
             I turned my collar to the cold and damp
             When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
             That split the night
             And touched the sound of silence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third-verse">
        <p>And in the naked light I saw
          Ten thousand people, maybe more.
          People talking without speaking,
          People hearing without listening,
          People writing songs that voices never share 
          And no one dared 
          Disturb the sound of silence.</p>
